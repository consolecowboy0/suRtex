Description: suRtex was designed for easy descriptive statistic reporting of categorical survey data (e.g., Likert scales) in LaTeX. suRtex takes a matrix or data frame and produces the LaTeX code necessary for a sideways table creation. Mean, median, standard deviation, and sample size are optional.
